# Client Side Structured Data Editor: a Disruptive Kata

# What is Disruptive Kata?

**Disruptived Kata** is a code kata driven by a product idea.

It start from a need or an idea or product that may be more or less interesting or relevant. 
From then, requirements are written. It is followed by the spexifications and, finally, by its implementation in a more *traditional* code kata form.

For the implementation, we encourage the red-green-refactor TDD methodology.
But 3 aspects are at the heart of the *disruptive* approach:
  - katas must take their inspiration in a real problematic
  - developers are involved in the creation of the solution
  - a special attention is givne to the communication of ideas and solutions
