# Client Side Structured Data Editor: a Disruptive Kata

# What is Disruptive Kata?

**Disruptive Kata** is a code kata driven by real ideas.
No matter that this idea is great, new or revolutionary. It simply have to be a true and honest idea.

From there, requirements (precision of the problematic) and specification (precise description of the solution) are written. Implementation in a more *traditional* code kata form follows.

We advocate for the use of industry standards as formats for requirements and specifications.
We also recommend the use of software architecture diagrams.
For the implementation, we strongly encourage the *red-green-refactor* TDD methodology.

But to be disruptive, tools and technology is not relevant. 
Here are 3 basic criterias for a *Disruptive Kata*:
  - kata inspiration comes from a real problematic,
  - solution is a creative processe in which developers are involved and
  - a special attention is given to the communication of ideas:
    - problematic,
    - problem,
    - solution and
    - implementation.

  We think the harder in a disruptive kata is the expression of the idea that ignate ha kata.
